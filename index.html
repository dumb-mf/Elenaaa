 				It's your special day, baby.  
				Even though we haven't met yet,
				you've become such a constant in my world—
				a soft thought that lingers,
				a feeling I carry with me every day. 
				The closest thing to home in my heart.
				
				

				Sometimes I think—
				maybe being apart isn't so bad,
				because it gives me more time to dream.
				More time to prepare.

				I imagine us meeting…
				and It always got me questioning—
				Will it be under city lights? Maybe somewhere quiet, just us two?
				How will our first kiss feel? With the night breeze brushing against our skin?
				Will our hearts beat like thunder? 
				I yearn for that moment to be perfect, because you deserve nothing less.
				I want everything to be perfect.

				But I know myself—
				I'll probably trip over my words,
				my hands will shake,
				I'll be too nervous to look at you.
				maybe I'll really run far away—
				to compose myself
				you'll run after me, or perhaps you won't
				but if u do, I can already imagine u being mad cuz I ran away
				and then I'll crack a stupid joke
				just to soften the moment. 
				
				then maybe we'll laugh through the nervous blushes
				that feel like we're on the edge of passing out.
				
				And maybe… that's what love is.
				Not perfect, not planned, full of laughter, and maybe anger from ur side
				It's real, it's flawed
				And it's ours to keep.
				
				Our little moments keep on flooding my mind
				our own little bubble
				the jokes only we understand
				the butterflies, even without the presence of one another
				the silent warmth that travels through every message,
				the way your words feel like a gentle touch,
				even miles apart.

				It's strange how distance can't dull what's true—
				because in this quiet space between us,
				I find a love that's patient, messy, and beautifully ours.
				

				Happy birthday again, my baby.
				I may not be there to hold you today,
				but I hope you feel my heart reaching out to yours.
				I hope it surrounds you with every gentleness and 
				warmth you could ever deserve. 
				I love you, Elena, till the end of my lifetime and beyond.
